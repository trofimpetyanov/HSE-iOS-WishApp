**HW-4**

1. **Add new button for scheduling wish-granting activity.** ✅

2. **Buttons color changes depending on the background color.** ✅

3. **Pressing the schedule button pushes `WishCalendarViewController`.** ✅

4. **`WishCalendarViewController` has a collection view in it.** ✅

5. **`WishEventCells` can be created with event title, description, start and end dates.** ✅

6. **Events for cells can be created in a popup shown using `present()`.** ✅

7. **Event is created in the calendar.** ✅
   
8. **Events are saved in app so that they stay after the app is closed.** ✅

9. **A wish can be picked from saved wished list when scheduling an event.** ✅

10. **The color picked on the `WishMakerViewController` is now passed to be
background color for other screens.** ❎
   - Setting the background looks ugly, so I've implemented small details such as the colored plus button and the event cell border.
